/*
The following CSS variables define the main, public API for styling JupyterLab.
These variables should be used by all plugins wherever possible. In other
words, plugins should not define custom colors, sizes, etc unless absolutely
necessary. This enables users to change the visual theme of JupyterLab
by changing these variables.

Many variables appear in an ordered sequence (0,1,2,3). These sequences
are designed to work well together, so for example, `--jp-border-color1` should
be used with `--jp-layout-color1`. The numbers have the following meanings:

* 0: super-primary, reserved for special emphasis
* 1: primary, most important under normal situations
* 2: secondary, next most important under normal situations
* 3: tertiary, next most important under normal situations

Throughout JupyterLab, we are mostly following principles from Google's
Material Design when selecting colors. We are not, however, following
all of MD as it is not optimized for dense, information rich UIs.

i know. i think it may rain.

it&#39;s the middle of summer, it shouldn&#39;t rain today.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
that would be weird.
neg: 0.362, neu: 0.638, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.1779, 
yeah, especially since it&#39;s ninety degrees outside.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.732, pos: 0.268, compound: 0.296, 
i know, it would be horrible if it rained and it was hot outside.

yes, it would be. 
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.526, pos: 0.474, compound: 0.4019,

i&#39;d rather be cold than hot.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
it doesn&#39;t look very nice outside today.

you&#39;re right. i think it&#39;s going to rain later.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
in the middle of the summer, it shouldn&#39;t be raining.

that wouldn&#39;t seem right.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
considering that it&#39;s over ninety degrees outside, that would be weird.
neg: 0.145, neu: 0.855, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.1779, 
exactly, it wouldn&#39;t be nice if it started raining. it&#39;s too hot.

it wouldn&#39;t rain in the middle of the summer.

it wouldn&#39;t seem right if it started raining right now.

it would be weird if it started raining in ninety degree weather.
neg: 0.134, neu: 0.866, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.1779, 
any rain right now would be pointless.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
that&#39;s right, it really would be.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i want it to cool down some.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.526, pos: 0.474, compound: 0.3818, 
i know what you mean, i can&#39;t wait until it&#39;s winter.

winter is great. i wish it didn&#39;t get so cold sometimes though.

the tv news doesn&#39;t tell us the race anymore.

of course not. that would be racist.
neg: 0.4, neu: 0.6, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.6124, 
but how can we identify someone if we don&#39;t know their race?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0,

i didn&#39;t have time to get one from there.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
your sleeves are not tissues.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
but mom, all my friends use their sleeves.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.628, pos: 0.372, compound: 0.631, 
that doesn&#39;t make it right.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i saw dad wipe his nose on his sleeve yesterday.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i will talk to your father about that.

i bet dad did it all the time when he was my age.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
your daddy was a good little boy.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.633, pos: 0.367, compound: 0.4404, 
i&#39;m worried.

you should be happy, not worried.

i am happy, but marriage is a lot of responsibility.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.749, pos: 0.251, compound: 0.3291, 
yes, you have to take care of your wife.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.543, pos: 0.457, compound: 0.7096, 
and i have to take care of our children.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.686, pos: 0.314, compound: 0.4939, 
are you going to start a family?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
yes. we want to have a little boy and a little girl.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.667, pos: 0.333, compound: 0.4588, 
that sounds wonderful.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.351, pos: 0.649, compound: 0.5719, 
except we can&#39;t afford it!
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i don&#39;t get art.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
or artists.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
they&#39;re in a different world.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i saw a painting of a jar that was full of pencils.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
the artist said the jar was both full and empty.
neg: 0.167, neu: 0.833, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.2023, 
but it was full of pencils! how could he say it was empty?
neg: 0.172, neu: 0.828, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.3595, 
artists see things differently.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
did you ever see anything that picasso painted?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
of course! he&#39;s world famous.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
did he ever take art lessons?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i can&#39;t believe it. i drew paintings like that in third grade.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.783, pos: 0.217, compound: 0.3612, 
what&#39;s the point?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
the point of what?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
of living.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
who knows? you live, and then you die.
neg: 0.358, neu: 0.642, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5994, 
we must be here for some reason.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
maybe we&#39;re here to have fun.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.602, pos: 0.398, compound: 0.5106, 
then why aren&#39;t i having fun?
neg: 0.403, neu: 0.597, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4023, 
because you&#39;re thinking too much.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
so i should stop thinking?
neg: 0.452, neu: 0.548, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.3566, 
stop thinking about what the point is.
neg: 0.268, neu: 0.732, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.296, 
okay. i&#39;ll start thinking about having some fun.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.536, pos: 0.464, compound: 0.6369, 
beer is a powerful drug.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.517, pos: 0.483, compound: 0.4215, 
so are cigarettes.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
which would you prefer?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
what do you mean?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
when you die and go to heaven, they will offer you beer or cigarettes.
neg: 0.203, neu: 0.625, pos: 0.172, compound: -0.1531, 
i could pick only one or the other?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
yes. nothing&#39;s perfect, not even in heaven.
neg: 0.206, neu: 0.305, pos: 0.488, compound: 0.5716, 
boy, that&#39;s a tough one.
neg: 0.333, neu: 0.667, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.128, 
what&#39;s so tough about it? of course, i would pick cigarettes.
neg: 0.166, neu: 0.834, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.2006, 
but cigarettes taste much better when you have a cold beer.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.7, pos: 0.3, compound: 0.5927, 
well, you can&#39;t have everything.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.656, pos: 0.344, compound: 0.2732, 
my pants have a hole in the front pocket.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
you shouldn&#39;t carry pens in your pocket.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
yesterday a pen fell through my pants onto my shoe.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
lucky for you it wasn&#39;t a sharp knife.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.682, pos: 0.318, compound: 0.4215, 
who carries a sharp knife in their pocket?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
criminals, of course.
neg: 0.649, neu: 0.351, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5719, 
anyway, i have to fix the hole.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
you can sew it up or use an iron-on patch.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
tell me about this patch.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
the patch has glue. the hot iron melts the glue so the patch sticks on.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
that sounds a lot easier than sewing.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.641, pos: 0.359, compound: 0.4215, 
do you know any good jokes?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.449, pos: 0.551, compound: 0.5994, 
i can&#39;t remember jokes.
neg: 0.465, neu: 0.535, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.1877, 
neither can i.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
they go in one ear and out the other.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
who makes up all these jokes?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.714, pos: 0.286, compound: 0.25, 
who knows? but there must be a hundred new ones every day.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
yes, just in english alone.
neg: 0.26, neu: 0.39, pos: 0.351, compound: 0.1779, 
i wonder if every language has jokes.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.714, pos: 0.286, compound: 0.25, 
of course! people everywhere like good jokes.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.342, pos: 0.658, compound: 0.7712, 
what do you think people joke about the most?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.784, pos: 0.216, compound: 0.296, 
i think most jokes are about women.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.686, pos: 0.314, compound: 0.3167, 
you&#39;re very lucky.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.393, pos: 0.607, compound: 0.4754, 
why do you say that?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
you speak two languages.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
well, my english isn&#39;t perfect.
neg: 0.37, neu: 0.37, pos: 0.259, compound: -0.2259, 
no one speaks perfect english.
neg: 0.247, neu: 0.337, pos: 0.416, compound: 0.3612, 
maybe i will be the first!
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i&#39;ve been thinking about learning spanish.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
spanish is easy. i&#39;ll be happy to teach you.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.515, pos: 0.485, compound: 0.765, 
how long will it take me to learn?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i think it will only take you a year or two.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
how soon can we begin?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0,

yes, it&#39;s april 22.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.526, pos: 0.474, compound: 0.4019, 
it&#39;s more than just a date.

is it your birthday or anniversary?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
no, it&#39;s earth day.
neg: 0.423, neu: 0.577, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.296, 
what&#39;s that?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
it&#39;s a yearly reminder to take care of our planet.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.714, pos: 0.286, compound: 0.4939, 
oh, you mean like reuse things and recycle stuff?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.762, pos: 0.238, compound: 0.3612, 
yes. we need to think green, save water, and stop using plastic bags.
neg: 0.122, neu: 0.552, pos: 0.326, compound: 0.5719, 
how about if i take shorter showers?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
that&#39;s a good idea, because showers waste a lot of water.
neg: 0.22, neu: 0.551, pos: 0.228, compound: 0.0258, 
poetry sucks.
neg: 0.714, neu: 0.286, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.3612, 
i don&#39;t know anyone who likes it.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.641, pos: 0.359, compound: 0.4215, 
some of it is okay, i guess.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.725, pos: 0.275, compound: 0.2263, 
yes, the poems that rhyme and are easy to remember.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.588, pos: 0.412, compound: 0.6808, 
like &#34;one, two, buckle my shoe.&#34;
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.667, pos: 0.333, compound: 0.3612, 
but people still write poems.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
no one makes any money at it.
neg: 0.268, neu: 0.732, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.296, 
shakespeare was a poet.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
did he get rich from his poetry?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.625, pos: 0.375, compound: 0.5574, 
probably not.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
poems are a little bit like songs.

how smart are you?

what do you mean?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
if you&#39;re going to make a wish, wish that you were really rich or famous.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.542, pos: 0.458, compound: 0.8516, 
don&#39;t you ever wonder what it&#39;s like to be super-smart?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.783, pos: 0.217, compound: 0.3612, 
it must be very lonely.
neg: 0.411, neu: 0.589, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4201, 
why&#39;s that?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i missed the tv news last night. what was on?

well, mostly i&#39;ll try to avoid it.
neg: 0.237, neu: 0.538, pos: 0.226, compound: -0.0258, 
i mean, are you going to get buried or cremated?

oh, no. our ashes will be shaken into the ocean.
neg: 0.304, neu: 0.696, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.3612, 
you&#39;re not going to be buried?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
a coffin costs too much and takes up too much space.

a flag should be pretty.

what should our flag look like?

it should have a pretty woman on it.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.652, pos: 0.348, compound: 0.4939, 
that&#39;s ridiculous!
neg: 0.736, neu: 0.264, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4199, 
you don&#39;t like pretty women?

neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
every nation should have a pretty woman on their flag.

then i did my laundry.

that takes some time.

i took the dog for a walk.

i vacuumed the entire house.

it&#39;s one dollar for 100 minutes.

that&#39;s only a penny a minute!
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
it&#39;s a great price. but you have to dial a lot of numbers.

how many?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0,

i don&#39;t park at a store that uses metal shopping carts.

i&#39;m a good card player.

why is that?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
because i watch the other players.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
what do you mean?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
people will tell you if they have a good hand.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.534, pos: 0.466, compound: 0.7269, 
how do they do that?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
for example, a friend of mine licks his lips.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.686, pos: 0.314, compound: 0.4939, 
when he licks his lips, you know he has a good hand?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.596, pos: 0.404, compound: 0.7269, 
i know he has a good hand, so i don&#39;t bet.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.496, pos: 0.504, compound: 0.7269, 
he never wins your money?

but you can&#39;t win if you don&#39;t play.
neg: 0.526, neu: 0.474, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.7692, 
ha! you can&#39;t win if you do play.
neg: 0.233, neu: 0.38, pos: 0.387, compound: 0.2547, 
someone has to win.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.441, pos: 0.559, compound: 0.5859, 
that&#39;s what everyone says.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
it might as well be me.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.704, pos: 0.296, compound: 0.2732, 
that&#39;s what everyone says.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
you&#39;re trying to tell me something.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
that didn&#39;t take long.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
you think i should quit playing.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.69, pos: 0.31, compound: 0.2023,

how could that be?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
well, you can&#39;t play baseball in a rainstorm.
neg: 0.223, neu: 0.547, pos: 0.23, compound: 0.0165, 
i thought they were playing under a dome.

it&#39;s a little bitter, but it&#39;s okay.

i wonder if i should bring my gloves.

maybe you should, just in case it gets colder.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0,

why not?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
she would laugh at me.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.526, pos: 0.474, compound: 0.5574, 
how do you know?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
because they always do.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
maybe she&#39;s different.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
they&#39;re all the same.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0,

neg: 0.0, neu: 0.392, pos: 0.608, compound: 0.4767, 
i&#39;m not in the mood.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
what&#39;s the matter?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.645, pos: 0.355, compound: 0.0258, 
i saw you looking at that woman.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
what woman?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
you know, that woman with the big boobs.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i was not looking at her.

you were, too.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i&#39;m not interested in her.
neg: 0.361, neu: 0.639, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.3089, 
then why were you looking at her?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i was looking at something else.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
would you like to go on a blind date?
neg: 0.241, neu: 0.536, pos: 0.223, compound: -0.0516, 
you must be joking.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.612, pos: 0.388, compound: 0.2263, 
no, i&#39;m serious.
neg: 0.778, neu: 0.222, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.3612, 
i don&#39;t want to date a blind woman.
neg: 0.495, neu: 0.505, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4445, 
a blind date doesn&#39;t mean that she is blind!
neg: 0.487, neu: 0.513, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.69, 
what does it mean?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
a blind date is a date with someone you don&#39;t know.
neg: 0.252, neu: 0.748, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4019, 
why would i date someone i don&#39;t even know?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
to try something new and exciting.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.61, pos: 0.39, compound: 0.4939,

she was standing behind me in a really slow line at the checkout counter.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
what did you say to her?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i had two pineapples in my cart, and she asked where i had found them.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
she asked you about your pineapples?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i told her i had gotten the last two on the shelf, but i offered her one of mine.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
that was nice of you.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.588, pos: 0.412, compound: 0.4215, 
she asked me how she could return the favor, so i asked her out.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.816, pos: 0.184, compound: 0.4019, 
did you have a date friday night?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
yes, in fact, i did.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.526, pos: 0.474, compound: 0.4019, 
who did you go out with?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
a man i met in a coffee shop.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
where did you go?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
we went to a nice restaurant.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.588, pos: 0.412, compound: 0.4215, 
anywhere else?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
then we went to a jazz club.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
that sounds like a nice date.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.361, pos: 0.639, compound: 0.6486, 
yes, it was pleasant.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.25, pos: 0.75, compound: 0.7184, 
but you won&#39;t date him again?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i had the worst date the other night.
neg: 0.406, neu: 0.594, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.6249, 
what happened?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
first of all, he was half an hour late.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
that&#39;s not a good start.
neg: 0.445, neu: 0.555, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.3412, 
then he didn&#39;t bother to apologize.
neg: 0.177, neu: 0.546, pos: 0.278, compound: 0.1877, 
that&#39;s rude.
neg: 0.75, neu: 0.25, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4588, 
then he drove too fast to the restaurant.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
that&#39;s dangerous.
neg: 0.756, neu: 0.244, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4767, 
i thought about getting out and taking a taxi home.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
what happened at the restaurant?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
we had a $40 meal, and he left a $1 tip!
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i don&#39;t like that man.
neg: 0.413, neu: 0.587, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.2755, 
why not?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
he&#39;s a dirty old man.
neg: 0.492, neu: 0.508, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4404, 
what do you mean?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
he&#39;s old enough to be my father, yet he asked me out.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
well, you can&#39;t blame a man for asking.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.547, pos: 0.453, compound: 0.4829, 
he should act his age.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
but a lot of old people are still interested in dating.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.717, pos: 0.283, compound: 0.5499, 
they should find a nice hobby.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.588, pos: 0.412, compound: 0.4215, 
just wait until you&#39;re 50 years old.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
dating will be the furthest thing from my mind.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
does your girlfriend ever make you angry?
neg: 0.355, neu: 0.645, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5106, 
sometimes.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
what does she do?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
just yesterday, i told her i wouldn&#39;t trade her for all the money in the world.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
that was a nice thing to say.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.641, pos: 0.359, compound: 0.4215, 
that&#39;s what i thought.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
what did she say?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
she laughed! she didn&#39;t believe me.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.603, pos: 0.397, compound: 0.5093, 
that wasn&#39;t very nice of her.
neg: 0.338, neu: 0.662, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.3713, 
she said that nothing is more important to me than money.
neg: 0.153, neu: 0.847, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.2044, 
what did you say?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
some people have good noses.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.58, pos: 0.42, compound: 0.4404, 
i wish i had a good nose. mine is way too big.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.556, pos: 0.444, compound: 0.6808, 
i don&#39;t mean good-looking. i mean good-smelling.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
oh. but that can be a curse.
neg: 0.487, neu: 0.513, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.6956, 
yes, because you can be too sensitive to odors.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.748, pos: 0.252, compound: 0.4019, 
i&#39;ll say. my girlfriend has a nose like a drug dog.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.762, pos: 0.238, compound: 0.3612, 
did she catch you using drugs?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
sort of. she knows whenever i sneak a cigarette.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
you don&#39;t need a good nose for thatcigarettes stink.
neg: 0.46, neu: 0.54, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.6256, 
but when i sneak just one cigarette in the morning, she can smell it that evening!
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
boy, that is a good nose.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.58, pos: 0.42, compound: 0.4404, 
let&#39;s go out to eat.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
that sounds like fun.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.256, pos: 0.744, compound: 0.7003, 
where do you want to go?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.794, pos: 0.206, compound: 0.0772,

i know a good chinese restaurant.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.508, pos: 0.492, compound: 0.4404, 
how far away is it?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0,

oh, no. we can walk right in.
neg: 0.268, neu: 0.732, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.296, 
i can&#39;t believe how long this line is.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
this is a popular restaurant, isn&#39;t it?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.641, pos: 0.359, compound: 0.4215, 
yes, but it isn&#39;t a fast-food restaurant, is it?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.791, pos: 0.209, compound: 0.2144, 
it&#39;s the slowest hamburger in town.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
that&#39;s because they cook it while you wait.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
yes. that&#39;s why it&#39;s also the best hamburger in town.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.537, pos: 0.463, compound: 0.7845, 
a great burger and great service.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.268, pos: 0.732, compound: 0.8481, 
yes, the workers are very polite.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.649, pos: 0.351, compound: 0.4019, 
and they&#39;re clean.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.426, pos: 0.574, compound: 0.4019, 
i&#39;ve been coming here for years.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0,

thank you.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.286, pos: 0.714, compound: 0.3612, 
what kind of soup was that?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
it was tomato soup.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
that tasted so good.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.445, pos: 0.555, compound: 0.5777, 
i put lemon and butter in it.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
the sandwich was good, too.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.58, pos: 0.42, compound: 0.4404, 
everyone likes bacon and tomato sandwiches.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.641, pos: 0.359, compound: 0.4215, 
especially on toast.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
and the pickles were great, too.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.549, pos: 0.451, compound: 0.6249, 
tomorrow we&#39;ll have rice and fish for lunch.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i&#39;m calling the waiter.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
what&#39;s the matter?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.645, pos: 0.355, compound: 0.0258, 
this steak has too much fat.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
what do you want the waiter to do?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.843, pos: 0.157, compound: 0.0772, 
bring me a better steak.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.508, pos: 0.492, compound: 0.4404, 
i wouldn&#39;t do that.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
why not?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
they will drop the new steak on the floor, step on it, and then spit on it.
neg: 0.116, neu: 0.884, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.2732, 
you&#39;re crazy.
neg: 0.706, neu: 0.294, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.34, 
then the waiter will give you a big smile as he brings you the new steak.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.848, pos: 0.152, compound: 0.3612, 
where do you get these crazy ideas?
neg: 0.286, neu: 0.714, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.34, 
let&#39;s leave.
neg: 0.545, neu: 0.455, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.0516, 
but we just got here.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
did you see the waiter&#39;s hands?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
no.
neg: 1.0, neu: 0.0, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.296, 
he had dirty fingernails.
neg: 0.492, neu: 0.508, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4404, 
really?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
his nails were black!
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
that&#39;s disgusting.
neg: 0.773, neu: 0.227, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5267, 
and he poured water into our glasses.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
yuck! no water for me.
neg: 0.384, neu: 0.616, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.3595, 
i wonder if the cooks&#39; nails are dirty, too.
neg: 0.293, neu: 0.707, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4404, 
this hot bread is delicious.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.519, pos: 0.481, compound: 0.5719, 
i like this restaurant because they give you free bread.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.547, pos: 0.453, compound: 0.7003, 
well, i think we are paying for it.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.741, pos: 0.259, compound: 0.2732, 
no. look at the bill when we get it. there&#39;s no charge for the bread.
neg: 0.253, neu: 0.747, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5267, 
it is delicious, especially with butter.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.575, pos: 0.425, compound: 0.5719, 
i think we should just leave after we fill up on the bread.
neg: 0.098, neu: 0.902, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.0516, 
they probably wouldn&#39;t like that.
neg: 0.345, neu: 0.655, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.2755, 
i&#39;m eating so much bread that i&#39;m getting full.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
then stop eating the bread!
neg: 0.384, neu: 0.616, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.3595, 
okay, just one more piece. pass the butter, please.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.625, pos: 0.375, compound: 0.4939, 
if i owned a restaurant, i would never serve hot bread before the main course.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
is this a clean restaurant?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.526, pos: 0.474, compound: 0.4019, 
well, the tables and chairs look okay.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.556, pos: 0.444, compound: 0.4588, 
okay, let&#39;s sit down.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.612, pos: 0.388, compound: 0.2263,

it passes inspection.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
here comes the waiter. see if his hands and nails are clean.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.803, pos: 0.197, compound: 0.4019, 
well, the waiter looked clean, so i guess it&#39;s okay to eat here.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.564, pos: 0.436, compound: 0.7152, 
you&#39;re forgetting about the bathroom.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i&#39;m going to just hope that the bathroom is clean.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.588, pos: 0.412, compound: 0.6808, 
you&#39;re not going to examine it before we order dinner?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
no, i&#39;d rather not find out that it&#39;s dirty, because i&#39;m pretty hungry right now.
neg: 0.251, neu: 0.591, pos: 0.158, compound: -0.2263, 
have you seen our waiter?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
here he comes now.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
we&#39;ve been sitting here for almost 10 minutes.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
oops, i guess i was wrong. that isn&#39;t our waiter.
neg: 0.307, neu: 0.693, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4767, 
we can give him five more minutes, and then leave.

i&#39;ll go up front and talk to the manager.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
that&#39;s a good idea.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.408, pos: 0.592, compound: 0.4404, 
maybe they&#39;ll give us free drinks for waiting so long.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.732, pos: 0.268, compound: 0.5106, 
maybe he&#39;ll send us our waiter immediately.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
every time we eat out, it&#39;s an adventure.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.753, pos: 0.247, compound: 0.3182, 
last time, we got seats next to the kitchen.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
is this table okay?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.612, pos: 0.388, compound: 0.2263, 
no, it&#39;s too close to the kitchen door.
neg: 0.239, neu: 0.761, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.296, 
how about this table?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
no, it&#39;s too close to the front door.
neg: 0.239, neu: 0.761, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.296, 
this looks like a nice table.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.361, pos: 0.639, compound: 0.6486, 
no, it&#39;s too close to the salad bar.
neg: 0.239, neu: 0.761, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.296, 
okay, i give up.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.513, pos: 0.487, compound: 0.2263,

i don&#39;t believe the art world.

he&#39;s a famous artist.

he drew two butterflies and a flower on a napkin in a restaurant.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
did he sign it?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
yes.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.0, pos: 1.0, compound: 0.4019, 
is it beautiful?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.339, pos: 0.661, compound: 0.5994, 
it&#39;s just black ink on a white napkin. and the napkin has food stains!
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
so it&#39;s not worth much?
neg: 0.325, neu: 0.675, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.2334, 
only about $30,000.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
can we go to the baseball game?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0,

i love to eat the hot dogs.

i hope we&#39;ll see a home run.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.58, pos: 0.42, compound: 0.4404, 
i hope we&#39;ll catch a foul ball.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.58, pos: 0.42, compound: 0.4404, 
bring a jacket.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
yes. it gets a little cool at night.

bring a glove to catch a foul ball.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
golf is a silly game.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.732, pos: 0.268, compound: 0.0258, 
it certainly is.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.455, pos: 0.545, compound: 0.34, 
you hit a white ball.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
and then you chase it.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
and then you hit it again.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
finally, you put the ball into a hole in the ground.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
you do this 18 times, because there are 18 holes.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
what&#39;s the point?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
how can it be fun?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.548, pos: 0.452, compound: 0.5106, 
they pay money to play this silly game!
neg: 0.137, neu: 0.489, pos: 0.374, compound: 0.3436, 
i think golfers have a mental problem.

where do you want to go?

we can go to the river.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
or we can go to the lake.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
or we can go to the ocean.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
let&#39;s go to the lake.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
yes. the lake is only 10 miles away.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.722, pos: 0.278, compound: 0.4019, 
we can be there in 20 minutes.

i&#39;ll get our fishing rods.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i&#39;ll get the bait.

i like to slide into the bases.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.667, pos: 0.333, compound: 0.3612, 
yeah. it&#39;s a lot of fun to slide.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.476, pos: 0.524, compound: 0.6705, 
i want to be a baseball player when i grow up.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.843, pos: 0.157, compound: 0.0772, 
me too. i want to play for the yankees.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.619, pos: 0.381, compound: 0.4019, 
not me. i want to play for the dodgers.
neg: 0.127, neu: 0.624, pos: 0.249, compound: 0.291, 
we have to practice every day.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i don&#39;t like practice.
neg: 0.513, neu: 0.487, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.2755, 
me neither. it&#39;s boring.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.605, pos: 0.395, compound: 0.2411, 
let&#39;s go jogging.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
that&#39;s a good idea.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.408, pos: 0.592, compound: 0.4404, 
i bought some new shoes.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
are they comfortable?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.377, pos: 0.623, compound: 0.5106, 
they&#39;re very comfortable.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.358, pos: 0.642, compound: 0.5563, 
how much were they?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
they were on sale for $80.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
do they help you run faster?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.649, pos: 0.351, compound: 0.4019, 
no, but my feet don&#39;t hurt anymore.
neg: 0.156, neu: 0.487, pos: 0.357, compound: 0.4703, 
then they&#39;re worth every penny.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.678, pos: 0.322, compound: 0.2263, 
you might want to buy a pair.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.794, pos: 0.206, compound: 0.0772, 
tiger is the greatest golfer in the world.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.625, pos: 0.375, compound: 0.6369, 
you can say that again.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
but i&#39;m worried about tiger.
neg: 0.412, neu: 0.588, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4215, 
why is that?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
because he likes to scuba dive.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.641, pos: 0.359, compound: 0.4215, 
what&#39;s wrong with that?
neg: 0.508, neu: 0.492, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4767, 
it can be dangerous.
neg: 0.508, neu: 0.492, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4767, 
you mean he could drown.
neg: 0.481, neu: 0.519, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5719, 
he shouldn&#39;t scuba dive until he retires.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
but he dives to relax.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.51, pos: 0.49, compound: 0.5927, 
he might relax, but it makes me nervous.
neg: 0.25, neu: 0.566, pos: 0.184, compound: -0.1779, 
did you watch that golf tournament?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
the one that tiger won?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.519, pos: 0.481, compound: 0.5719, 
how did he do it?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
it was nothing for him.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
he sank a 20-foot putt on the last hole to win by one stroke!
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.746, pos: 0.254, compound: 0.6239, 
he sank a 25-footer last year at the same tournament to win by one stroke.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.774, pos: 0.226, compound: 0.5859, 
i think he is from outer space.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
no human could possibly play golf that well.
neg: 0.188, neu: 0.427, pos: 0.385, compound: 0.3182, 
whenever he needs a shot to win a tournament, he makes that shot.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.725, pos: 0.275, compound: 0.5859, 
no human can do that.
neg: 0.355, neu: 0.645, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.296, 
somebody should check his birth record.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
who&#39;s the greatest baseball player?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.488, pos: 0.512, compound: 0.6369, 
there are so many great players.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.533, pos: 0.467, compound: 0.6573, 
yes, but who is the greatest?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.343, pos: 0.657, compound: 0.8248, 
i&#39;d have to say babe ruth.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
most people would say that.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
he changed the game.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
yes, he made the home run popular.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.476, pos: 0.524, compound: 0.6705, 
everybody loved him, all over the nation.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.606, pos: 0.394, compound: 0.5994, 
he helped make the yankees the best team ever.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.656, pos: 0.344, compound: 0.6369, 
and ruth was a good person, too.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.633, pos: 0.367, compound: 0.4404, 
he always visited hospitals to cheer up sick kids.
neg: 0.243, neu: 0.515, pos: 0.243, compound: 0.0, 
did you hear what happened at the baseball game?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
no, please tell me.
neg: 0.338, neu: 0.308, pos: 0.354, compound: 0.0258, 
someone punched out someone.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
that&#39;s not nice.
neg: 0.538, neu: 0.462, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.3252, 
it&#39;s worse than that.
neg: 0.508, neu: 0.492, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4767, 
how so?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
two guys got into an argument.
neg: 0.333, neu: 0.667, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.3612, 
i&#39;ll bet they were drinking.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
a third guy punched one of the two guys.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i&#39;ll bet he was drinking, too.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
the victim hit his head on the concrete steps and died.
neg: 0.388, neu: 0.612, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.6908, 
i want to go to the ball game.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.822, pos: 0.178, compound: 0.0772, 
is there a game tonight?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
yes, it starts at 7 p.m.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.597, pos: 0.403, compound: 0.4019, 
can we get tickets?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
yes, but only the cheap tickets.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.73, pos: 0.27, compound: 0.2144, 
how much are they?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
they&#39;re only $5 each.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
that&#39;s a good price.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.408, pos: 0.592, compound: 0.4404, 
yes, it&#39;s cheaper than a hot dog or a beer.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.722, pos: 0.278, compound: 0.4019, 
where are the seats?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
they&#39;re behind the outfield.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
golf is so hard.
neg: 0.384, neu: 0.616, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.2183, 
what&#39;s so hard about hitting a little white ball?
neg: 0.195, neu: 0.805, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.1761, 
it&#39;s hard if you want to do it right.
neg: 0.144, neu: 0.722, pos: 0.134, compound: -0.0258, 
you mean like tiger?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.545, pos: 0.455, compound: 0.3612, 
no, like a good amateur golfer.
neg: 0.229, neu: 0.208, pos: 0.562, compound: 0.4939, 
what&#39;s so hard about golf?
neg: 0.297, neu: 0.703, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.1761, 
there are so many things you have to do right.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
like what?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.286, pos: 0.714, compound: 0.3612, 
like keep your left arm straight, keep your head down, and follow through.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.714, pos: 0.286, compound: 0.5267, 
yikes! who can remember all that?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
you need to get a lot of lessons when you&#39;re really young.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
did you hear about the ball player?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
the home run hitter on drugs?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
he said a doctor helped him with a personal problem.
neg: 0.278, neu: 0.722, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4019, 
he said he wasn&#39;t using drugs.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
he apologized to the fans.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.635, pos: 0.365, compound: 0.3182, 
the league suspended him for 50 games.
neg: 0.341, neu: 0.659, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4767, 
that will cost him some money.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
yes, about $7 million.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.526, pos: 0.474, compound: 0.4019, 
that will teach him a good lesson.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.633, pos: 0.367, compound: 0.4404, 
he probably won&#39;t use drugs anymore.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
but it won&#39;t stop other players from using drugs.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.774, pos: 0.226, compound: 0.3252, 
why is there so much crime?
neg: 0.43, neu: 0.57, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5829, 
because parents don&#39;t teach their kids right from wrong.
neg: 0.279, neu: 0.721, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4767, 
is that it?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
also, there aren&#39;t enough police.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
but there are a lot of police.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
there&#39;s only one police officer per 100 criminals.
neg: 0.346, neu: 0.654, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5719, 
can&#39;t we hire more police?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
no. it costs too much money.
neg: 0.306, neu: 0.694, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.296, 
doesn&#39;t crime cost more than police?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.637, pos: 0.363, compound: 0.431, 
yes, it does.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.426, pos: 0.574, compound: 0.4019, 
so it would be cheaper to hire more police?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
this is a great neighborhood.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.423, pos: 0.577, compound: 0.6249,

the man fell asleep.

did he die?

yes, he did. his cat died, too.
neg: 0.319, neu: 0.442, pos: 0.239, compound: -0.2263, 
that&#39;s too bad. what about his smoke alarm?
neg: 0.496, neu: 0.504, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.7096, 
the battery was dead.
neg: 0.589, neu: 0.411, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.6486, 
a good battery would have saved his life.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.467, pos: 0.533, compound: 0.6908, 
he had cigarettes, but no battery.
neg: 0.359, neu: 0.641, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4215, 
they say he has started fifteen big fires.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
he&#39;s been in jail three times already.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
why did they ever let him out?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
it&#39;s the law. they can&#39;t keep him in jail forever.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
why not? everyone knows he&#39;s a firebug. he loves to start fires.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.73, pos: 0.27, compound: 0.5719, 
i don&#39;t know. sometimes the law doesn&#39;t make sense.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
but his latest fire killed someone.
neg: 0.7, neu: 0.3, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.8847, 
this time they have charged him with murder.
neg: 0.52, neu: 0.48, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.7579, 
so maybe he&#39;ll go to jail forever?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i sure hope so.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.161, pos: 0.839, compound: 0.6369, 
someone should set him on fire.

put your seatbelt on.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
why?

because it will protect you in case of an accident.
neg: 0.226, neu: 0.584, pos: 0.19, compound: -0.128, 
but it&#39;s uncomfortable.
neg: 0.63, neu: 0.37, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5267, 
it&#39;s the law.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
it&#39;s so much trouble.
neg: 0.498, neu: 0.502, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4549, 
it&#39;s common sense.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
it&#39;s so tight that it&#39;s hard for me to breathe.
neg: 0.135, neu: 0.865, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.1027, 
hold your breath till we get there.

are you crazy?
neg: 0.545, neu: 0.455, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.34, 
what&#39;s the matter?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.645, pos: 0.355, compound: 0.0258, 
those books will slip and you&#39;ll fall.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
it&#39;s only a couple of feet.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
what if you fall while you&#39;re holding the light bulb, and it breaks and pieces go into your eyes?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i never thought about that.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
you&#39;d be blind for the rest of your life!

did you see that puddle of water on the floor?

yes. i called for a clean-up.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.526, pos: 0.474, compound: 0.4019, 
a puddle of water is very dangerous.
neg: 0.404, neu: 0.596, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5256, 
it isn&#39;t easy to see.
neg: 0.376, neu: 0.624, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.3412, 
but it&#39;s real easy to slip on.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.609, pos: 0.391, compound: 0.5927, 
especially on these slick floors.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
someone who slips could hurt their back.
neg: 0.362, neu: 0.638, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5267, 
they could even crack their head open.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
we should stand here till the clean-up person gets here.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
we can leave if we put an orange cone here.
neg: 0.118, neu: 0.882, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.0516, 
yes, but i don&#39;t know where the orange cones are.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.812, pos: 0.188, compound: 0.2144, 
what happens when the fire alarm rings?
neg: 0.49, neu: 0.51, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5859, 
we tell our students to leave the classroom.
neg: 0.146, neu: 0.854, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.0516, 
can they take their belongings?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
yes, if they do it quickly.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.649, pos: 0.351, compound: 0.4019, 
where do the students go?

they go out to the north parking lot.

what do the teachers do?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
we take our rosters to the parking lot and take roll.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
why do you do that?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
we want to make sure all the students are out of the building.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.753, pos: 0.247, compound: 0.3818, 
if they are all outside, then what?

i have to check the stove.

what&#39;s the matter?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.645, pos: 0.355, compound: 0.0258, 
maybe i left the burner on.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0,

up to $200 for each gun, no questions asked.
neg: 0.397, neu: 0.603, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5574, 
why are they doing this?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
they want to get guns off the street.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.843, pos: 0.157, compound: 0.0772, 
who would turn in a gun for $200?
neg: 0.286, neu: 0.714, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.34, 
that isn&#39;t a good deal?
neg: 0.445, neu: 0.555, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.3412, 
a good gun costs $400 or more.
neg: 0.258, neu: 0.43, pos: 0.312, compound: 0.128, 
well, if you bring your receipt, maybe they&#39;ll give you $400.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.826, pos: 0.174, compound: 0.2732, 
i&#39;ll keep my receipt and my gun.

the mayor says the crime rate is going down.
neg: 0.304, neu: 0.696, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5423, 
then why does everyone lock their doors?

people who live in california are crazy.
neg: 0.286, neu: 0.714, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.34, 
why is that?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
because of all the earthquakes and fires.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
but big earthquakes happen only once in a while.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
once in a while is once too many.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
but you&#39;re right. there are a lot of fires.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
a recent fire destroyed 85 homes.
neg: 0.651, neu: 0.349, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.6808, 
still, it&#39;s safer than florida.

florida doesn&#39;t have earthquakes or fires.

no, florida just has hurricanes every year from june to october.
neg: 0.18, neu: 0.82, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.296,

a tutor helped me get the d!

so, you didn&#39;t become a doctor.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
and now i&#39;m glad that i didn&#39;t.

ask the clerk.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i will.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
oh, look. here&#39;s another shirt just like it.

does it have a price tag?

i hope you kept the receipt.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.58, pos: 0.42, compound: 0.4404, 
you think they won&#39;t fit?
neg: 0.345, neu: 0.655, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.2755, 
i think i&#39;ve put on some weight.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
you think?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
maybe a pound or two.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
maybe four or five pounds?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
my waist is bigger than it was.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
no problem. these pants have an elastic waistband.
neg: 0.45, neu: 0.55, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5994, 
what do we need to buy?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
let me look at our list.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i know that we need milk.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
nonfat.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
of course. what else?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0,

of course, the cheese with holes in it.

i need some pants.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i thought you just bought a pair.

i did.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
what&#39;s wrong with them so soon?
neg: 0.383, neu: 0.617, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4767, 
the pants are fine, but the pocket has a huge hole in it.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.697, pos: 0.303, compound: 0.5187, 
you shouldn&#39;t carry your keys and pens in your pocket.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
but that&#39;s what pockets are for.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
you should carry them in a purse.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i&#39;m a man, and men don&#39;t carry purses!
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
well, you should buy pants with stronger pockets.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.561, pos: 0.439, compound: 0.5719, 
i would if i could find someone who makes strong pockets.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.708, pos: 0.292, compound: 0.5106, 
what are those wipes for?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
you use them to wipe the handle of the shopping cart.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
that&#39;s a great idea.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.328, pos: 0.672, compound: 0.6249, 
yes, all the markets just started offering wipes to shoppers.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.769, pos: 0.231, compound: 0.4019, 
i&#39;m going to take five wipes.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
what do you need five of them for?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
one to wipe the handle, and the others to wipe the produce.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
what&#39;s the matter with the produce?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.82, pos: 0.18, compound: 0.0258, 
do you think the bananas fell from the sky?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
what do you mean?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i mean, someone used their dirty hands to pick the bananas, the apples, and the oranges.
neg: 0.172, neu: 0.828, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4404, 
did you go to the 99 cents store?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
yes, i did.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.27, pos: 0.73, compound: 0.4019, 
what did you buy?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
well, i got a lot of good deals, as usual.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.545, pos: 0.455, compound: 0.6124, 
like what?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.286, pos: 0.714, compound: 0.3612, 
well, a dozen large eggs were only 99 cents.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.769, pos: 0.231, compound: 0.2732, 
that&#39;s a good deal.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.408, pos: 0.592, compound: 0.4404, 
and a one-pound tub of soft butter was the same price.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
another good deal.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.408, pos: 0.592, compound: 0.4404, 
but the best deal was five pounds of potatoes for 99 cents.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.655, pos: 0.345, compound: 0.7783, 
i don&#39;t know how that store makes money.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i need a new computer.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
what&#39;s the matter with yours?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.784, pos: 0.216, compound: 0.0258, 
it&#39;s six years old.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
that&#39;s pretty old.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.385, pos: 0.615, compound: 0.4939, 
it still works, but i&#39;m going to give it to a charity.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.73, pos: 0.27, compound: 0.5719, 
are you going to buy a desktop or laptop?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
oh, a laptop, of course.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
a pc or a mac?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i haven&#39;t decided yet.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
more and more people are using macs.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
but 90 percent of the world uses pcs.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i got ripped off.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
what happened?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i had a car problem, so i went online.
neg: 0.351, neu: 0.649, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4019, 
did you find a solution?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.566, pos: 0.434, compound: 0.3182, 
yes, i did. a site i went to said they would send me the solution.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.667, pos: 0.333, compound: 0.6124, 
so, what&#39;s the problem?
neg: 0.497, neu: 0.503, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4522, 
i sent them $20 using my credit card, but they never sent me the solution.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.716, pos: 0.284, compound: 0.5789, 
what are you going to do?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i sent them an email asking for my money back.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0,

i already looked there.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
did you look in the desk drawer?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
yes, i looked there, too.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.526, pos: 0.474, compound: 0.4019, 
don&#39;t we have about five sharpeners?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
yes, but they seem to have legs.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.764, pos: 0.236, compound: 0.2144, 
tomorrow i&#39;m going to buy an electric sharpener.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0,

neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0,

how are you doing that?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i started shopping at the dollar store.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
that saves a lot of money.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i bought three pounds of potatoes for a dollar.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
that&#39;s a good deal.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.408, pos: 0.592, compound: 0.4404, 
yes, even though some of the potatoes had eyes.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.748, pos: 0.252, compound: 0.4019, 
just put them in the fridge.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
also, i bought a can of cheap coffee and a bag of good coffee.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.775, pos: 0.225, compound: 0.4404, 
why did you do that?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i mixed them together.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i really like this house.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.518, pos: 0.482, compound: 0.4201, 
can we afford it?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
they want 20 percent down.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.755, pos: 0.245, compound: 0.0772, 
that&#39;s a lot of money.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
but the house is so nice.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.504, pos: 0.496, compound: 0.7118, 
it&#39;s in a great neighborhood.

it&#39;s close to the beach.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
it&#39;s close to the freeways.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
it&#39;s got a big yard.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
the kids love the house, too.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.543, pos: 0.457, compound: 0.6369, 
if we don&#39;t buy it, someone else will.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
we can&#39;t afford this house.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
are you sure?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.465, pos: 0.535, compound: 0.3182, 
we will be house rich, but cash poor.
neg: 0.333, neu: 0.482, pos: 0.185, compound: -0.431, 
what do you mean?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
our monthly payments will be too high.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
we won&#39;t have any money for other things?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
no, we won&#39;t have money for gas or food.
neg: 0.216, neu: 0.784, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.296, 
we&#39;ll be eating peanut butter sandwiches?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
without the peanut butter!
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
that&#39;s no good!
neg: 0.344, neu: 0.156, pos: 0.499, compound: 0.2481, 
we have to find a cheaper house.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
that is a beautiful house.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.435, pos: 0.565, compound: 0.5994, 
i don&#39;t like it.
neg: 0.513, neu: 0.487, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.2755, 
what&#39;s the matter with it?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.784, pos: 0.216, compound: 0.0258, 
it&#39;s on the corner.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
so?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
that means it gets twice as much traffic.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
you&#39;re right.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
when you&#39;re inside, you will always hear cars stopping and stopping at the intersection.
neg: 0.211, neu: 0.789, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.296, 
or you&#39;ll hear the collision if someone doesn&#39;t stop.
neg: 0.22, neu: 0.615, pos: 0.166, compound: -0.1561, 
or you&#39;ll see the collision if they crash into the house.
neg: 0.366, neu: 0.634, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.6369, 
let&#39;s find a house that&#39;s at the end of a dead end.
neg: 0.323, neu: 0.677, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.6486, 
i hate looking for an apartment.

neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
no. that will cost too much money.
neg: 0.268, neu: 0.732, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.296, 
so it&#39;s better to save money than to have an honest election?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.482, pos: 0.518, compound: 0.8651, 
well, the democratic party says it was an honest election.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.464, pos: 0.536, compound: 0.7964, 
i see that former president bush is at a conference.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
yes. he&#39;s telling jokes about his eight years as president.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.63, pos: 0.37, compound: 0.5719, 
yes, those eight years were a lot of fun for everyone.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.571, pos: 0.429, compound: 0.7184, 
only 4,000 american soldiers were killed overseas.
neg: 0.429, neu: 0.571, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.6705, 
not to mention 40,000 wounded soldiers.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
but bush visited some of them in the hospital once.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
that&#39;s nice that he found the time to make a visit.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.763, pos: 0.237, compound: 0.4215, 
he spoke to them and made them feel better.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.734, pos: 0.266, compound: 0.4404, 
did he speak to every family that lost a soldier?
neg: 0.223, neu: 0.777, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.3182, 
no, he didn&#39;t have time to do that.
neg: 0.239, neu: 0.761, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.296, 
well, he&#39;s got plenty of time now!
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.715, pos: 0.285, compound: 0.3382, 
did you get your official sample ballot?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
yes, with the voter instructions.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.597, pos: 0.403, compound: 0.4019, 
how are you going to vote?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
same as ever, by mail. all it costs me is a 42-cent stamp.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i meant, are you going to vote for or against the new taxes?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
against all of them, of course.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
but we need new taxes to pay for highways, schools, and prisons.
neg: 0.127, neu: 0.873, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.1531, 
we&#39;ve already voted for new taxes to pay for all that stuff!
neg: 0.133, neu: 0.867, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.1759, 
that&#39;s true. where did that money go?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.682, pos: 0.318, compound: 0.4215, 
our legislators spent it on first-class travel all over the world.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
they are having a good time with our money.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.707, pos: 0.293, compound: 0.4404, 
have you decided how you are going to vote?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
do you mean on measures 1, 2, and 3?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
yes. the ones that will improve our schools, roads, and hospitals.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.616, pos: 0.384, compound: 0.6808, 
you mean the measures that will raise our taxes.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
but the tv ads say that our taxes will not increase.
neg: 0.196, neu: 0.804, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.3491, 
do you believe the tv ads?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i like the one where the fireman tells us why we should vote yes.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.679, pos: 0.321, compound: 0.6369, 
don&#39;t believe him! whatever the tv ads tell you, the opposite is true.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.795, pos: 0.205, compound: 0.4753, 
but the title of measure 1 is &#34;better schools at no cost.&#34;
neg: 0.179, neu: 0.575, pos: 0.246, compound: 0.2617, 
the title should be &#34;better schools at huge cost.&#34;
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.574, pos: 0.426, compound: 0.6369, 
i can&#39;t believe that they would lie to us.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i have a stomachache.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
is it something you ate?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
maybe. i&#39;m not sure.
neg: 0.395, neu: 0.605, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.2411, 
what did you have for breakfast?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
the usual, cereal with milk and a banana.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
maybe the milk was bad.
neg: 0.467, neu: 0.533, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5423, 
it didn&#39;t smell bad.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.513, pos: 0.487, compound: 0.431, 
maybe the banana was bad.
neg: 0.467, neu: 0.533, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5423, 
no, the banana was delicious.
neg: 0.247, neu: 0.337, pos: 0.416, compound: 0.3612, 
maybe you just need to go to the bathroom.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
no, that&#39;s not the problem.
neg: 0.295, neu: 0.402, pos: 0.303, compound: 0.015, 
what&#39;s this stain?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i don&#39;t know.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
it looks like blood.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.545, pos: 0.455, compound: 0.3612, 
i think my nose was bleeding.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
you should wet your shirt immediately.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
why?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
because that gets the blood out of the shirt.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
what&#39;s a little blood?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
your white shirt is ruined.
neg: 0.437, neu: 0.563, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4767, 
so, i&#39;ll just buy another one.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
you can wear this one around the house.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
my fingers hurt.
neg: 0.63, neu: 0.37, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5267, 
why do they hurt?
neg: 0.531, neu: 0.469, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5267, 
i type too much.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
you should take a break.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i need to type to make money.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
but typing is causing you pain.
neg: 0.471, neu: 0.529, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.6652, 
maybe i should see a doctor.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
doctors are too expensive.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
he might tell me to rest for a while.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
he might want to cut you open.
neg: 0.25, neu: 0.595, pos: 0.155, compound: -0.2023, 
he might say i&#39;m okay.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.678, pos: 0.322, compound: 0.2263, 
what did the doctor say?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
he thinks i have too much stress.
neg: 0.359, neu: 0.641, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4215, 
stress causes your stomachaches?
neg: 0.483, neu: 0.517, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4215, 
stress causes different problems with different people.
neg: 0.524, neu: 0.476, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.6705, 
so what did he tell you to do?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
he said i need to think positive.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.581, pos: 0.419, compound: 0.5574, 
he didn&#39;t give you any medication?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i hate medication. it makes me feel different.
neg: 0.381, neu: 0.619, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5719, 
so how do you think positive?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.581, pos: 0.419, compound: 0.5574, 
i think about nice things.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.517, pos: 0.483, compound: 0.4215, 
like what?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.286, pos: 0.714, compound: 0.3612, 
i cut my finger.
neg: 0.512, neu: 0.488, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.2732, 
how did you do that?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
it&#39;s a paper cut.
neg: 0.512, neu: 0.488, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.2732, 
paper can be dangerous.
neg: 0.508, neu: 0.492, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4767, 
it hurts, too.
neg: 0.608, neu: 0.392, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4767, 
paper cuts can hurt a lot.
neg: 0.651, neu: 0.349, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.6808, 
where are the band-aids?

i think they&#39;re in the medicine cabinet.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
it&#39;s on the tip of my finger.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
a band-aid might not work.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i must not use this finger until the cut heals.
neg: 0.208, neu: 0.792, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.2732, 
do you smell that?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
oh, yes.

one cigarette stinks up the whole sidewalk.

smokers think they are so cool.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.626, pos: 0.374, compound: 0.4572, 
they are so weak.
neg: 0.555, neu: 0.445, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5777, 
a little cigarette controls them.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
they look so stupid taking a puff.
neg: 0.466, neu: 0.534, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.656, 
and then they blow smoke out of their mouth.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
they think it&#39;s cool.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.566, pos: 0.434, compound: 0.3182, 
do you have a cold?

i want to get a tan. i don&#39;t want to look so pale.

what&#39;s wrong with looking pale?
neg: 0.437, neu: 0.563, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4767, 
people think you might be sick.

who thinks that?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0,

it&#39;s better to be pale than to have skin cancer.

i know that.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0,

then why can&#39;t i quit?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0,

i injured my back one time just by sneezing.
neg: 0.278, neu: 0.722, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4019, 
you should see a doctor.

when he is almost finished with one cigarette, he uses it to light another.

that&#39;s unbelievable. can he still breathe?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.735, pos: 0.265, compound: 0.2023, 
he can, but the people around him can&#39;t.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
how can he still be alive?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.658, pos: 0.342, compound: 0.3818, 
his doctor says his heart and lungs are strong and healthy.

i hate brushing my teeth.

they brushed with their fingers.

they also ate with their fingers!
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
why do they call it the good old days?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.734, pos: 0.266, compound: 0.4404, 
maybe because they didn&#39;t have to brush and floss.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
who invented flossing?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
a dentist, i&#39;m sure.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.465, pos: 0.535, compound: 0.3182, 
i hate flossing more than brushing!

it seems like i get a new pimple almost every day.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.762, pos: 0.238, compound: 0.3612, 
maybe it&#39;s something in your diet.

no, i eat the same things day after day.
neg: 0.239, neu: 0.761, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.296, 
then maybe it&#39;s in your genes.

you might be right.

do pimples run in your family?

not that i&#39;ve noticed.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
well, maybe it&#39;s from the pollution in the air.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.792, pos: 0.208, compound: 0.2732, 
whatever the cause, i hate seeing them on my face.

neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
yes, like the government says not to worry about the swine flu.
neg: 0.143, neu: 0.439, pos: 0.418, compound: 0.6131, 
but the swine flu just killed 20 people in mexico.
neg: 0.547, neu: 0.453, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.8922, 
the government says we have nothing to worry about.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.769, pos: 0.231, compound: 0.3412, 
then why are some schools telling the kids to stay home?

i didn&#39;t have a tissue.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
then wait till you find a tissue.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i couldn&#39;t wait. it was an emergency.
neg: 0.342, neu: 0.658, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.3818, 
oh, really? maybe you should have called 911.

don&#39;t let water get into any of the cracks.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i&#39;ll squeeze the cloth so it&#39;s almost dry.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
don&#39;t rub the numbers off the remote.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0,

what&#39;s the matter?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.645, pos: 0.355, compound: 0.0258, 
i was on a plane.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
so?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
so, every time the plane goes up, my ear starts to hurt.
neg: 0.236, neu: 0.764, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5267, 
that&#39;s no good.
neg: 0.361, neu: 0.164, pos: 0.475, compound: 0.1779, 
sometimes the pain goes away, and sometimes it doesn&#39;t.
neg: 0.292, neu: 0.708, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5106, 
have you seen a doctor?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i&#39;ve been to two doctors.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
and they couldn&#39;t fix your problem?
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.689, pos: 0.311, compound: 0.3089, 
they both said i have to live with it.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0,

she got an &#34;everything&#34; job!
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
what do you mean?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
a team of doctors gave her a whole new face.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
why did they do that?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
a mad dog bit most of her face off.
neg: 0.314, neu: 0.686, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.4939, 
oh, that&#39;s terrible. what does she look like now?
neg: 0.246, neu: 0.556, pos: 0.198, compound: -0.1531, 
her face is really fat, but they say the swelling will go down.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
and then will she look normal again?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0,

it aches most of the time.
neg: 0.286, neu: 0.714, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.25, 
what do you think it is?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
i don&#39;t know. i think it&#39;s old age.
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
if it&#39;s old age, why don&#39;t both of your hands hurt?
neg: 0.254, neu: 0.746, pos: 0.0, compound: -0.5267, 
that&#39;s a good question. maybe it&#39;s not old age.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.707, pos: 0.293, compound: 0.4404, 
are you right-handed?
neg: 0.0, neu: 1.0, pos: 0.0, compound: 0.0, 
yes. all my life.
neg: 0.0, neu: 0.526, pos: 0.474, compound: 0.4019, 
you&#39;re wearing out your right hand. stop using it so much.
